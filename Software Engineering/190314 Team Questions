(1. How should we cope with these days' software engineering; explain including the software model and the way to deal with expired software.
Component-based:
Open source software already. Finding and assembling the components is needed to reflect and match the changing society.
Iterative:
Fast-changing-> customer requirements may change very fast. So the iterative model is appropriate to cope with the continuous feedback.
We cannot apply iterative model to some software, so it may not be the most appropriate.
Iterative also requires quite time to specificate the client's requirement.
2. On the slide 16th, which issue is the most important one at the aspect of software engineering?)

3. What are the problems that can happen at a web-based development environment?
Security problem:
The languages used for the web-based development are script languages including the JS, and the codes can be revealed
thus have the danger of the weakness being revealed (and attacked).
->Security of the open source software? The weakness is solved.
Cloud computing?

4. What is specific example of the reuse of software? Then, explain several profits of software reusing.
The weakness of software reusing?
The result of the software depends on the component that is reused. Also, it is very hard to find the exact component that matches the software.
