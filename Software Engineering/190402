1. Discuss and write your own ideas on why rapid development and delivery is
important from a business and technology perspective.
At a business perspective, it is very important to develop, deliver and release
the software rapidly as one of the critical standard of a success of the system
is the timing the system is released. Especially in the business market that deals
with the technology, the preoccupating companies earn some additional advantages
compared to latecomers of the field, assuming that the starter's product achieves
some certain level. After release, providing evolution to the system helps gathering
new customers and making existing customers loyal to the system as it matches their
new requirements. So rapid process is important.

2. Explain the principle of agile methods with each reason.
1) Customer involvement: By involving the customer, reflecting rapidly changing
requirements and evaluating the iterations of the system are enabled.
2) Incremental delivery: This enables the requirements to be fulfilled as fast as
it can be by providing new, specified requirements in closest increment.
3) People not process: By this principle, members of the development team can concentrate
and be recognized to what they have to do instead of wasting time to prescriptive processes.
4) Embrace change: This makes the whole system development and the system itself flexible.
5) Maintain simplicity: The complexity makes it harder to fulfill other principles.
By maintaining simplicity, the system gets simple and easy to understand, and it leads to
better system.

3. Discuss the strengths and problems of agile methods.
Strengths:
• Customer satisfaction by rapid, continuous delivery of useful software.
• People and interactions are emphasized rather than process and tools.
Customers, developers and testers constantly interact with each other.
• Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months).
• Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication.
• Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.
• Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.
• Regular adaptation to changing circumstances.
• Even late changes in requirements are welcomed.
Problems:
• It can be difficult to keep the interest of customers who are
involved in the process.
• Team members may be unsuited to the intense involvement that
characterizes agile methods.
• Prioritizing changes can be difficult where there are multiple
stakeholders.
• Maintaining simplicity requires extra work.
• Contracts may be a problem as with other approaches to iterative
development.

4. Summarize the determinants when deciding on a plan-driven or agile approach
to system development.
The determinants are the importance of a very detailed specification and design,
the realism of an incremental delivery strategy, the size, type, and the expected
lifetime of the system, the available technologies for supporting system development,
the way the development team is organized, cultural, organizational issues,
the skill levels of the designers and programmers, and the external regulation.

5. Discuss the release cycle of XP and compare it to the waterfall model.
The release cycle consists of six phases: selecting user stories for the release,
break down stories to tasks, plan release, develop/integrate/test software, release
software, evaluate system.
Difference:
Iteration/cycle, the lifetime of the process, reversing the phases,
the speed of change(new requirements) reflection.

6. Summarize the important features on practices of XP.
Incremental planning:
Requirements are recorded on story cards and the stories to be
included in a release are determined by the time available and
their relative priority. The developers break these stories into
development ‘Tasks’.
Small releases:
The minimal useful set of functionality that provides business
value is developed first. Releases of the system are frequent
and incrementally add functionality to the first release.
Simple design:
Enough design is carried out to meet the current requirements
and no more.
Test-first development:
An automated unit test framework is used to write tests for a
new piece of functionality before that functionality itself is
implemented.
Refactoring:
All developers are expected to refactor the code continuously as
soon as possible code improvements are found. This keeps the
code simple and maintainable.
Pair programming:
Developers work in pairs, checking each other’s work and
providing the support to always do a good job.
Collective ownership:
The pairs of developers work on all areas of the system, so that
no islands of expertise develop and all the developers take
responsibility for all of the code. Anyone can change anything.
Continuous integration:
As soon as the work on a task is complete, it is integrated into
the whole system. After any such integration, all the unit tests in
the system must pass.
Sustainable pace:
Large amounts of overtime are not considered acceptable as
the net effect is often to reduce code quality and medium term
productivity
On-site customer:
A representative of the end-user of the system (the customer)
should be available full time for the use of the XP team. In an
extreme programming process, the customer is a member of
the development team and is responsible for bringing system
requirements to the team for implementation.

7. Read the story card on slide 22 carefully and look for tasks 4 or above.
Task 4: Display the confirmed prescription for checking. 'OK' and 'Change' button is displayed.
'OK' leads to the recording on the database, while 'change' leads to the 'Prescribing
medication' process.

8. Explain test-driven development and think about the impact on SW quality.
In test-driven development, writing tests before code clarifies the requirements to be
implemented.
All previous and new tests are run automatically when new
functionality is added, thus checking that the new
functionality has not introduced errors.
TDD can cover the uncertainty of the program.

9. Summarize the advantages of pair programming.
Develop common ownership and spread knowledge across the team.
Serves as an informal review process, and encourages refactoring.

10. Explain the SCRUM process on slide 40.
After reviewing work to be done, item is selected from the product backlog
and the sprint is planned. After sprint, the potentially shippable software
is produced and sprint backlog is checked, reviewing the sprint. Then the
SCRUM process starts again from the reviewing work to be done.

11. Summarize the benefits of the SCRUM.
The product is broken down into a set of manageable and
understandable chunks.
• Unstable requirements do not hold up progress.
• The whole team have visibility of everything and
consequently team communication is improved.
• Customers see on-time delivery of increments and gain
feedback on how the product works.
• Trust between customers and developers is established and a
positive culture is created in which everyone expects the
project to succeed.

12. Summarize the strategies for scaling up and scaling out of agile methods.
• ‘Scaling up’ is concerned with using agile methods for
developing large software systems that cannot be developed
by a small team.
• ‘Scaling out’ is concerned with how agile methods can be
introduced across a large organization with many years of
software development experience.
Flexible planning, frequent system releases, continuous
integration, test-driven development and good team
communications.
