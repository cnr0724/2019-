Linear independence
Iff trivial solution
Dimension=maximum number of linearly independent vectors
Basis=set of n linearly independent vectors (such sets are not unique)

Representation
The list of scalars is the representation of v.

Coordinate-free geometry
Point exists in space regardless of any reference or coordinate system.
*Name to indicate more specific way is needed.
->Euclidean geometry.

Frame of reference.
Relate points and objects to our physical world.

좌표계=frames

Affine system (frame) & coordinate systems (vector space) difference….

4-D homogeneous coordinate representation can represent vectors and points in 3D Cartesian coordinates. 𝑝 = 𝑥’ 𝑦’ 𝑧’ 𝑤 T • If 𝑤 = 0, the representation refers to a vector. • If 𝑤 ≠ 0, the representation refers to a point in 3D. • If 𝑤 ≠ 0 and 𝑤 ≠ 1, we can return to a 3D point by dividing (𝑥′, 𝑦′, 𝑧′) by 𝑤.

Affine transformation: 12 degrees of freedom (Conceptual explanation.)

Affine transformation preserves lines.
