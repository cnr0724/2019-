Classes of the language according to the chomsky hierarchy.
Class #(Can tell more complicated grammar, pattern as number is smaller):
          Grammar / Language / Automata
Class 0:  Unrestricted Grammar / Turing Machine(impossible)
Class 1:  Context Sensitive Grammar / Linear Bounded Automata(impossible, natural language processing)
Class 2:  Context Free Grammar / Push Down Automata
Class 3:  Regular Grammar / Finite State Automata
Class가 높아질수록 할 수 있는 일은 늘어나지만 그만큼 cost도 비싸짐.
