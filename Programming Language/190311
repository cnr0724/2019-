What are the aspects of good programming languages?

1. Orthogonality
    Ability to combine various features of a language
    Ex: if(a<b) then s1 else s2
2. Support for abstraction
    Construct to factor out reccuring patterns
    Ex: Recursive Function
3. Natural for various applications
    Ex: For business, mathematics, science, game and etc.
4. Easy of program verification & debugging
    Formal verification & desk checking.
5. Portability and Transition
    Minimum degree of computation and space complexity
    Considering various architecture
