Set of instructions
Behavior
Result can be used in decision making(especially on the intelligent decision making)
Simulation model can be used anywhere, but especially discrete event.
Complicated system that cannot be expressed numerically. (->Artificial system.)
Limited expressability (ability to describe)
If the target system is expressed by logic, the expression should be on the Boolean logic.
Expressing by mathematics is hard.
->Discrete event simulation.
Existing system: analysis, modification, extension, testing alternative strategies(->get better than certain system, optimality.)
Future system: design (including dynamics)
Intelligent: control, planning, monitoring.
Simulation system classification
1) Continuous (time) simulation
System-(abstraction)->model
Modeling과 abstraction
2) Discrete (time) simulation
Piece-wise constant
3) Discrete event simulation
2)면 계산해야 할 시점이 잘못될 수도 있겠지만 이건 좀 덜함…몰라.
Structure를 주려고 하니 Modularity가 필요함
Target이 주어지면 simulation model을 통해 그 structure를 구현하고 target system/component의 behavior도 표현해야 함.
Behavior expression=sum of expression of small behaviors.
Simulation environment: simulauto? 
Input/ Model, System/Output
Differential equation
3)에 집중함.
Terminology
State variables: variables representing model’s situation (state)
Model state: model’s current status (state variable의 collection으로 표현)
Event: change of Model state (internal event), external input/output event
